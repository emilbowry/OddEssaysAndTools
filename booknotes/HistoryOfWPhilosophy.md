Berkeley: to exist is to be perceived, do not perceive material things on qualities and perceptions in the mind. Criticism: no definition of word mental, he thinks stuff is either material or mental.

Counterargument to Berkeley’s mental number of possible combinations of multiplications of integers is infinite, so some must have not been thought of, but answers still exist.
Hume: impression is a perception which have more force than violence, ideas are like impressions but fainter. Simple ideas are simple
