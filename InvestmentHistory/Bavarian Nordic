# Introduction: Investing in Bavarian Nordic during the monkeypox panic

During the monkeypox panic, I decided to invest in Bavarian Nordic, BAVA.CO, by buying long CFDs. My reasoning was that they had the patent and production for all monkeypox vaccines. I predicted that the company's share price would rise due to the panic and because they were becoming increasingly profitable, even without vaccine sales, thanks to other products they offered.

## Reasoning: Patent and production for monkeypox vaccines, and increasing profitability

My reasoning for investing in Bavarian Nordic was based on their ownership of the patent and production for all monkeypox vaccines. I also believed that the company was becoming more profitable due to other products they offered, in addition to the expected demand for their vaccines.

## Due diligence: Analyzing first and second quarter results

To make an informed decision, I focused my due diligence on the first and second quarter results of Bavarian Nordic. I wanted to understand how the company had been performing in the past and what their future outlook was.

### JYNNEOS profit decrease in Q2 indicates overall profitability

After analyzing the results, I noted that the net loss had significantly decreased between the two quarters, without the influence of the monkeypox scare, as there were no orders for JYNNEOS in the second quarter. This decrease of 320 DKK in JYNNEOS profit between Q1 and Q2 indicated that the company would becoming more profitable overall, with new worldwide demand for JYNNEOS.

## Attending the monkeypox vaccine update conference

To learn more about JYNNEOS and its contracts, I attended the monkeypox vaccine update conference before confirming my position. This helped me to gain a deeper understanding of the product and the market.

## Unforeseen circumstances: Putin's threat and Nord Stream Pipeline destruction

Unfortunately, I ended up making a loss on the position due to unforeseen circumstances. Putin threatened to cut off Denmark's gas supply immediately after I confirmed my position, which caused a decline in the share price. Moreover, the destruction of the Nord Stream Pipeline was also an unpredictable event that affected the company's performance.

## Loss and recovery: Share price decline and subsequent increase

After Putin's threat was later known to be a bluff, the share price increased almost by 100%. However I pulled out before these could be realised.

## Hindsight: Unpredictable events and making informed decisions

Looking back, I realized that some events were outside of my control, such as Putin's threat and the pipeline destruction. However, I still believe that I made an informed decision based on the information available at the time. In the end, investing is always a risk, and sometimes unexpected events can impact the outcome.
