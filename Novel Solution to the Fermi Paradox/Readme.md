<h1 id="title">The biggest problem Engineering can fix</h1>
<h2>Misery and a novel solution to the Fermi-Paradox</h2>
<h3>Part 1: Why do we solve problems?</h3>

<p>Humans are different to other animals, unlike other animals we are constantly improving ourselves and the world we live in. This drive throughout human history has led us to our modern society where most of us do not have to worry about surviving through the next week, avoiding death from exposure, predators or lack of food. But why do we possess this need for progression? </p>
<p>I believe the reason is humanity’s ability to not be satisfied with life. Imagine a world where people were perfectly content with their lives. Perhaps this seems like a utopia - everything we do centres around that goal - from developing new products to make people's lives easier or new political systems to spread justice and equality to improve lives. But what would drive you to go to work or do anything if no matter what condition you were in you were perfectly happy? </p>
<p>
   Similarly, early humans originally lived in caves which gave them little safety from exposure, predators and lack of food. We also started with primitive hunting techniques which developed into tools and weapons. Early humans that were the most unsatisfied with their way of life were more likely to seek improvements. Those with the nature to seek improvement are more likely to reach an improved level. Better living conditions lead to us having more time to reproduce, and possibly a better chance at finding more mates by being in a more desirable position. From this it makes sense that this tendency is propagated through the population.  People who inherently desire for better conditions, have a higher likelihood of reaching better conditions and therefore have a higher likelihood of reproducing and their offspring surviving longer.
</p>
<p>
   Research in psychology also backs my hypothesis, Lykken, D. and Tellegen. A (1996) “Happiness is a Stochastic Phenomenon”, tested pairs of twins over 10 years and concluded that happiness had over a 50% genetic factor. Further, if our progression leads to a permanent increase in happiness, progress surely would plateau off, with societal progress following. We do not see this, so our happiness level must reset to a baseline. A similar theory in psychology is called “Hedonic setpoint theory” which was first discussed in Brickman, P. and Campbell, D (1997) "Hedonic Relativism and Planning the Good Society" . Cases of tolerances such as this are found all throughout human biology such as tolerances to substances and stimuli, which I argue is to bring us back, in the most case, to a state of being below a state of happiness.
</p>
<p>
   The above can be summarised in three assumptions:<br>
   <ul>
         <li>Will to improve life conditions is decreases as happiness in that position increases./li>
         <li>Humans are inherently just below happy and content with life so we are driven to improve our life conditions.</li>
         <li>People who seek better conditions are more likely to achieve better conditions.</li>
   </ul>
   <br>
   These characteristics spread throughout the early population of humans until all humans have some level of being unsatisfied with their state in life. To satisfy the primordial sense of having to improve, some people take this feeling into wanting to become richer, successful or happier, and when asking people what they think their meaning of life is, many will say the above. But in my opinion, as engineers, this drives us to solve problems to make the world a better place.

</p>
<h3>How to solve this problem and how does it relate to engineering?</h3>
<p>
   If this hypothesis is correct, it is a rather depressing reality, so how can we fix this. Technologies such as CRISPR are allowing us to manipulate genetics in a more and more precise manner, but to me the largest hurdle seems to be understanding the entire human genome and how this relates to our individual characteristics. Advances in bioinformatics and machine learning could make this a much easier task rather than current methods of analysing the functions of genes - looking at mutations and how they individually affect our phenotypes. The task becomes far more complex one since genes do not individually each represent a characteristic but different genes code for different proteins that interact in complex ways, leading to a massive information problem.
</p>
<h3>What would the consequences of this be?</h3>
<p>
   We stated that progress was inversely proportional to happiness. However, from this it does not mean that when we become more happy progress completely stops. It may be possible to make humans more content without completely destroying society. Being slightly happier would lead to slower progression but not the end to total progression. But with the technology to be perfectly bliss at all time would you choose to only have a fraction of this? Maybe this choice would lead to society consciously choosing effectively to end itself, after all who would choose to go to work if you're completely happy doing nothing at home.
</p>
<p>
   This perhaps leads to a novel solution to the Fermi-Paradox. Assuming other extraterrestrial civilisations develop in a similar way (revolving around lack of satisfaction), and are sufficiently advanced, they could potentially remove this tendency and live in complete bliss. It seems natural to say that there would be no driving factor to explore the rest of the galaxy if you were content in your home world. Perhaps progress would stagnate, and every society would tend to a similar point. Therefore, there would be no evidence for us to see extraterrestrial life. This fulfils the position of a potential “Great Filter”, that prevents society progressing.
</p>
<p>
   If we did choose to only slightly increase our happiness, all could still not be well. Genetic tampering often leads to unintended consequences - think about the amount of chaos and diseases we have given to dogs with only mild breeding. To genetically tamper with ourselves this much, we would need to be able to completely understand the human genome. We are nowhere near understanding what even some individual genes do, yet alone understanding how all genetic changes affect other processes, or the emergent phenomenon of tampering with multiple genes. So fortunately, this potential apocalypse is far off. However, the rewards for getting this right would be unimaginable.
